This section covers how to build high-quality, successful mini apps for the Base app. Your app should meet all product, design, and technical guidelines and be designed for virality.

<Note>
  To submit your app for featured placement, first verify your mini app in the [Base Build dashboard](https://base.dev/), then fill out the [submission form](https://buildonbase.deform.cc/getstarted/).

  Meeting these guidelines is a prerequisite for featured placement, but ***does not guarantee placement.*** Base holds a very high bar for featured placement.
