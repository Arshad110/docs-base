description: Learn what a Mini App manifest is, why signing it matters, and how to generate and add an account association to your app.
---

Every Mini App needs a **manifest** (`farcaster.json`) file to be recognized by Farcaster clients. It declares your appâ€™s details and domain, and when signed, produces an **Account Association** that proves your Farcaster account owns and can publish the app. Without it, your app wonâ€™t work as a Mini App.

### Prerequisites 

    - A deployed App, accessible via HTTPS 
    - A Base app account

## Location 
Your manifest file must be publicly accessible at:  
`https://your-domain.com/.well-known/farcaster.json`

## Sign Your Manifest

There are two supported ways to sign and generate your manifest:

  <Tab title="Base Build" icon="star">
    ## Option 1: Base Build Preview Tool

    1. Visit **[Base.dev](https://base.dev)** and sign in with your Base account.  
    2. Open **Preview â†’ Account Association**.  
    3. Enter your Mini App domain in the App URL field.  
    4. Click **Submit**. You should see a notification that you should verify your app ownership. Click **Verify â†’ Sign**.  
    5. Follow the on-screen instructions to sign the message in your wallet.  
    6. Click **Copy** to copy the generated `accountAssociation` object.  
    7. Paste it into your projectâ€™s `farcaster.json` under `accountAssociation`.  
    8. Redeploy your application to production.

    You should now see three green check marks indicating successful signing.

## Example Manifest


Hereâ€™s a simplified example of what a `farcaster.json` could look like from the [Base Camp Mini App](https://basecamp25.app/.well-known/farcaster.json):

```json
{
  "accountAssociation": {
    "header": "<generated-header>",
    "payload": "<generated-payload>",
    "signature": "<generated-signature>"
  },
  "miniapp": {
    "version": "1",
    "name": "Basecamp 2025",                // App name
    "description": "Access and manage your experience @ Basecamp", 
    "iconUrl": "https://basecamp25.app/icon.png",   // App icon
    "homeUrl": "https://basecamp25.app",            // Landing page
    "canonicalDomain": "basecamp25.app",            // Must match your domain
    "requiredChains": ["eip155:8453"],              // Chains your app supports
    "tags": ["basecamp", "miniapp"],                // Optional tags
    "requiredCapabilities": [                       // Capabilities your app needs
      "actions.ready",
      "actions.signIn"
    ]
  }
}
```
