title: "Building for The Base App"
description: "People use apps to have fun, learn, earn, or connect. Your mini app should focus on **one core need** and do it exceptionally well." 
---

The best apps are **simple, focused, and easy to understand.** 

<Steps>
<Step title="Ask yourself">

* What’s the **one thing** my app does really well?

* Why would someone **use it every day**?

* Why and when would someone **share it with a friend**?
</Step>

<Step title="Audience fit">

Base users are social, onchain-native, and interested in **creating, earning, trading, and connecting**.

</Step>

<Step title="Successful apps">

* Help people **earn** (e.g. rewards, yield, creator income)

* Help people **create** (e.g. minting, designing, storytelling)

* Help people **have fun** (games, collectibles, quizzes, social experiences with onchain elements)

* Are **simple,** **easy and satisfying** to use

* Have **low friction onboarding** — avoid:

  * Collecting personal info (address, phone number, etc.)

  * Requiring upfront deposits or complex setup steps

</Step>

<Step title="Group chat focus">

We’re especially excited about mini apps that make group chats more fun, functional, or rewarding — from games with onchain buy-ins, to tools like dinner-bill splitting with USDC.
