title: Base App Compatibility
description: Build Mini Apps with features that work seamlessly across the Base App and Farcaster.
---

Base App is working towards full compatibility with the Farcaster Mini App SDK. During beta, some features are not yet supported.

## Currently Unsupported 
- [`signManifest` (experimental)](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/docs/sdk/actions/sign-manifest)

## Base App Client Detection
To detect if the app is running in the Base App, you can use the `clientFid` property of the `context` object.

```tsx App.tsx
import { useMiniKit } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/minikit';

function MyComponent() {
  const { context } = useMiniKit();
  const isBaseApp = context.client.clientFid === 309857;

  if (isBaseApp) {
    // Use Base App-specific features
    console.log('Running in Base App');
  }
  
  return <div>{/* Your component */}</div>;
}
```

## Supported Chains

- Base 
- Mainnet 
- Optimism 
- Arbitrum 
- Polygon 
- Zora 
- BNB
- Avalanche Câ€‘Chain


We are actively expanding compatibility and will update this page as support increases.
