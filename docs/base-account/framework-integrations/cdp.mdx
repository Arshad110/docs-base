We are working to integrate Base Account with [CDP Embedded Wallets](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/embedded-wallets/welcome), and will publish guidance soon.

In the meantime, you can use the connector from the Base Account [Wagmi guide](/base-account/framework-integrations/wagmi/setup)
with CDP Embedded Wallets [Wagmi integration](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/embedded-wallets/wagmi).
