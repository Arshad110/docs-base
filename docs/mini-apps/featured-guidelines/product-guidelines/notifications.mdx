Notifications will allow you to re-engage users who have saved your Mini App, driving retention and bringing users back at key moments like new content releases, achievements, or time-sensitive events. 

Focus on sending updates that are relevant, well-timed, and valuable. It’s important to balance how many notifications you send — too many can cause users to turn them off entirely.

# Anatomy

* Title  
  * Short, clear statement of feature or what’s happening  
  * Max length 32 characters  
* Body  
  * Supporting detail or call-to-action  
  * Max length 128 characters  
* targetURL  
  * URL to open when the user clicks the notification  
  * Max length 1024 characters.Must be on the same domain as the Mini App.


# Best practices

1. **Keep notifications short and clear**  
   Each notification should be easy to scan. Use the title to state the key details, and keep the body text brief and focused on value. Users should know at a glance what is happening and why it matters.

2. **Control frequency**  
   Send notifications sparingly. Stay well below the enforced limit (1 every 30 seconds, maximum 100 per day) to avoid users from turning off notifications from your mini app. Focus on moments that truly benefit the user, and avoid sending multiple alerts close together.

3. **Deliver at the right time**  
   Timing shapes how notifications feel. Send them when they’re most relevant, such as after an event or during active hours. Avoid off-hours or interrupting while users are already in your mini app. Well-timed notifications feel helpful, not disruptive.

4. **Measure and refine**  
   Analytics reveal whether your notifications are working. High click-through rates show value, rising disabled rates mean you’re overwhelming users. Use these signals to adjust content, timing, or cadence so notifications remain useful.

# Types of notifications

Different mini apps use notifications in different ways. Choose the type that best fits your app’s purpose, and always keep the message relevant.

* **Reminders** encourage users to return regularly  
  * “Your crops are ready to harvest\!  
* **Events driven updates** highlight something new or time sensitive.  
  * “BTC is up 5% today\! Check your portfolio”  
* **Feature announcements** showcase new functionality or opportunities  
  * Example: “New quest unlocked\! More Coins are waiting for you\!”  
* **Alerts/warnings** share urgent or critical information  
  * Example: “Your balance is low. Top up to keep trading”  
    

Not every message deserves to be a notification, here are some to avoid:

* **Avoid overly generic nudges**. Messages with no clear value feel spammy, always explain why it matter to the user  
  * Example: “Open the app today\!”  
* **Avoid unnecessary confirmations**. Notifications should only confirm meaningful or irreversible events like payments or shipments  
  * Example: “You liked a post”
